A small project i am working on which will help japanese learners like myself practice kanji at their desired level. Curently the kanji is seperated
by JLPT level (JLPT is a standardized japanese proficiency test for foreigners)
I am thinking about changing the level classification to jouyou, which is way more standardized than JLPT.
To run the curent version, you have to run run.java
